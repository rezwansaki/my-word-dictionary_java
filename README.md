    <li>Get Random Word meaning.</li>
    <li>Try Similar Word (When user want the meaning/definition of a word but he/she doesn’t the correct spelling of the word then this function will help.)</li>
    <li>Advance search function : wildcard searching for both English and Bangla. such as search words which start with ‘aba’ or, which end with ‘able’ or, start with ‘আনা’ or, end with ‘করা’.</li>
    <li>Add Text to Speech function only for English.</li>
    <li>Add ‘More Suggestion’ function.</li>
    <li>Add ‘Word Image’ function. Get word meaning as an image from ‘Bangla Academy Dictionary’. This is also more accurate like ‘Gutenberg Dictionary’. Which I have used for English definition. But this image data file’s size are 70.8 MB. If you don’t want use this function, just go to the ‘data’ folder and then remove ‘dataAsImage’ folder.</li>
</ul>

### Tips:

It works without 'Word Image' folder 'db/dataAsImage' which size is 70.8 MB. But you can't see the result as image. So, you can remove that folder. <br/>
You can see the installation guide from 'screenshots' folder. <br/>
